================

This is a bastardised version of *Braubuddy* a temperature management framework written in Python.

The idea is to get a version running in python 3.x which uses a type of relay I bought off the next.

Sadly my use is more about brewing beer than contributing back so I've sawed bits of the original code base which played to extensiblity and reuse and made things very custom for my own needs :(
